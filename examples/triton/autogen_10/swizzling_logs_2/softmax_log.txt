--- MEMORY ANALYSIS ---
The `softmax_kernel` in Triton exhibits a memory access pattern where each block processes a single row of the input matrix. This results in contiguous memory access within each block, which is beneficial for cache utilization. The intra-block memory locality is high because each block accesses a contiguous segment of memory for both input and output. However, inter-block memory locality is limited since each block processes a different row, and there is no direct overlap in the memory accessed by different blocks.

To improve cache locality, especially for large matrices, consider swizzling the block IDs or reordering the rows in memory. This could ensure that blocks access rows that are stored closer together in memory, potentially reducing cache misses and improving performance. Additionally, ensuring that the input matrix is stored in a row-major order will naturally align with the current access pattern, further enhancing cache efficiency.

--- MEMORY ANALYSIS REASONING ---
The Triton kernel `softmax_kernel` is designed to compute the softmax function for each row of a 2D input tensor. The kernel is launched with a grid size of `(n_rows,)`, meaning each block in the grid is responsible for computing the softmax for one row of the input matrix. The memory access pattern and locality can be analyzed as follows:

1. **Memory Access Pattern:**
   - **Input Access:** Each block accesses a contiguous segment of the input tensor corresponding to a single row. The starting pointer for each row is calculated using `row_idx * input_row_stride`, and the elements within the row are accessed using `col_offsets`.
   - **Output Access:** Similarly, the output for each row is stored in a contiguous segment of the output tensor, starting at `output_row_start_ptr`.

2. **Memory Locality:**
   - **Intra-block Locality:** Within each block, the access to the input and output tensors is contiguous, which is optimal for memory locality. This means that once a block starts processing a row, it accesses memory locations that are close to each other, which can be efficiently cached.
   - **Inter-block Locality:** Since each block processes a different row, there is no direct memory locality between blocks. However, if the rows are stored contiguously in memory, the blocks will access memory locations that are close to each other in a sequential manner, which can still benefit from cache prefetching.

3. **Cache Utilization:**
   - The kernel's design inherently benefits from the hardware cache due to the contiguous access pattern within each block. However, the inter-block access pattern could be further optimized by ensuring that consecutive blocks access rows that are stored close together in memory, which is typically the case if the matrix is stored in row-major order.

4. **Potential for Optimization:**
   - If the input matrix is large and does not fit entirely in cache, the current access pattern might lead to cache thrashing when switching between blocks. Swizzling the block IDs or reordering the rows in memory could potentially improve cache locality by ensuring that blocks access rows that are more likely to be in cache.

Iteration 0:
Code optimization reasoning:
The current implementation of the `softmax_kernel` in Triton processes each row of the input matrix independently, with each block handling a single row. This results in high intra-block memory locality due to contiguous memory access within each block. However, inter-block memory locality is limited because each block processes a different row, leading to potential cache misses when blocks are scheduled across different XCDs. By swizzling the block IDs, we can improve cache locality by ensuring that blocks accessing the same or nearby data are scheduled to the same XCD, thus enhancing the L2 cache hit rate.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The original swizzling pattern did not consider the distribution of blocks across XCDs, leading to suboptimal cache utilization as blocks accessing related data could be scheduled to different XCDs, resulting in increased cache misses."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization involves implementing a swizzling pattern that reassigns block indices to ensure that blocks accessing the same or nearby data are scheduled to the same XCD. This is achieved by computing a new block index based on the original block index, the number of XCDs, and the total number of blocks. The goal is to maximize cache locality by grouping blocks with similar data access patterns within the same XCD, thereby improving the L2 cache hit rate and overall performance.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern should be better because it explicitly considers the distribution of blocks across XCDs, ensuring that blocks accessing related data are more likely to be scheduled to the same XCD. This should reduce cache misses and improve the L2 cache hit rate, leading to better performance. By balancing the workload across XCDs while maintaining data locality, the new pattern optimizes both cache utilization and computational efficiency.

Swizzling formula:
xcd_id = old_block_idx % num_XCD
round_id = old_block_idx // num_XCD
new_block_idx = round_id + xcd_id * (num_blocks // num_XCD)

--- PROFILING ITERATION 1 ---
L2 Cache Locality Improvement: Successfully improved L2 cache hit rate by 0.01 percentage points. Hit rate increased from 38.9% to 38.9% (higher percentages indicate better cache locality through improved block swizzling). Performance Loss: Experienced 1.03x slowdown with execution time increased from 0.16ms to 0.17ms (3.1% slower).

Iteration 1:
Code optimization reasoning:
The original code processes each row of the input matrix independently, which results in high intra-block memory locality but limited inter-block memory locality. The previous optimization attempt tried to improve cache locality by swizzling the block indices to map blocks that access the same data to the same XCD. However, the swizzling pattern used did not significantly improve cache locality and resulted in a slight performance degradation.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The swizzling pattern used in iteration 1 attempted to map blocks to XCDs based on a round-robin approach, but it did not effectively group blocks that access the same data to the same XCD. This resulted in minimal improvement in L2 cache hit rate and a slight performance slowdown due to increased complexity in block index computation."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization will implement a swizzling pattern that groups blocks accessing contiguous rows of the input matrix to the same XCD. This approach aims to improve cache locality by ensuring that blocks accessing adjacent rows are more likely to be scheduled on the same XCD, thus sharing the L2 cache more effectively.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern should be better because it directly targets the memory access pattern of the softmax operation, where adjacent rows are accessed in sequence. By mapping blocks that process these rows to the same XCD, we can improve the likelihood of cache hits in the L2 cache, reducing memory latency and potentially improving overall performance.

Swizzling formula:
xcd_id = old_block_idx % num_XCD
block_in_xcd = old_block_idx // num_XCD
new_block_idx = block_in_xcd * num_XCD + xcd_id

--- PROFILING ITERATION 2 ---

Iteration 2:
Code optimization reasoning:
The current implementation of the softmax kernel in Triton processes each row of the input matrix independently, which results in high intra-block memory locality but limited inter-block memory locality. The previous attempts at swizzling aimed to improve cache locality by reordering the block indices, but they did not achieve the desired performance improvements. The goal is to find a swizzling pattern that better aligns with the MI300X architecture, where blocks that access the same data are scheduled to the same XCD, thus improving L2 cache hit rates and overall performance.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The swizzling pattern attempted to distribute blocks across XCDs in a way that did not effectively group blocks accessing the same data, leading to minimal improvement in L2 cache locality and a slight performance slowdown.",
    "iteration 2": "The swizzling pattern further degraded L2 cache locality by rearranging blocks in a manner that increased cache misses, resulting in a more significant performance slowdown."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization will implement a swizzling pattern that groups blocks accessing the same data onto the same XCD more effectively. This will be achieved by calculating a new block index that considers both the original block index and the number of XCDs, ensuring that blocks are evenly distributed across XCDs while maximizing data locality.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern is designed to better align with the MI300X architecture by ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are more likely to be scheduled to the same XCD. This should improve L2 cache hit rates by reducing cache misses, as blocks that share data will be able to utilize the shared L2 cache of the XCD more effectively. Additionally, the even distribution of blocks across XCDs will help maintain balanced workload distribution, potentially improving overall performance.

Swizzling formula:
xcd_id = old_block_idx % num_XCD
block_in_xcd = old_block_idx // num_XCD

Iteration 3:
Code optimization reasoning:
The original code processes each row of the input matrix independently, which results in high intra-block memory locality but limited inter-block memory locality. The previous attempts at swizzling aimed to improve cache locality by reordering the block indices, but they did not achieve significant improvements. The goal is to find a swizzling pattern that better aligns with the hardware's cache architecture, specifically the multiple XCDs, to improve L2 cache hit rates and overall performance.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The swizzling pattern attempted to distribute blocks across XCDs but did not effectively group blocks that access the same data, leading to minimal improvement in cache locality.",
    "iteration 2": "The pattern changed the order of blocks within XCDs but did not address the need to group data-sharing blocks together, resulting in a decrease in cache locality.",
    "iteration 3": "The pattern attempted to further refine block distribution but still failed to group blocks accessing the same data, leading to a slight degradation in cache locality."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization will implement a swizzling pattern that groups blocks accessing the same data into the same XCD. This will be achieved by calculating a new block index that considers both the original block index and the number of XCDs, ensuring that blocks with shared data are assigned to the same XCD, thus improving cache locality and performance.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern is designed to group blocks that access the same data into the same XCD, leveraging the shared L2 cache within each XCD. This should improve cache hit rates by reducing the number of cache misses when blocks access shared data. By ensuring an even distribution of blocks across XCDs, the new pattern also maintains balanced workload distribution, which should enhance overall performance compared to previous attempts.

Iteration 4:
Code optimization reasoning:
The original code processes each row of the input matrix in a separate block, which results in high intra-block memory locality but limited inter-block memory locality. The previous optimization attempts tried to improve cache locality by reordering the block indices using different swizzling patterns. However, these attempts did not yield significant improvements in L2 cache hit rates or execution time, indicating that the swizzling patterns were not effectively grouping blocks that access the same data into the same XCD.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The swizzling pattern did not effectively group blocks accessing the same data into the same XCD, leading to minimal improvement in L2 cache hit rate and a slight performance slowdown.",
    "iteration 2": "The swizzling pattern further degraded L2 cache locality by not aligning well with the memory access patterns, resulting in a decrease in cache hit rate and increased execution time.",
    "iteration 3": "The swizzling pattern continued to degrade cache locality, as it did not effectively map blocks to XCDs based on shared data access, leading to a further decrease in performance.",
    "iteration 4": "The swizzling pattern did not improve cache locality, as it failed to group blocks accessing the same data into the same XCD, resulting in no performance gain."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization will implement a swizzling pattern that aims to group blocks accessing the same data into the same XCD more effectively. This will be achieved by calculating a new block index that considers both the original block index and the number of XCDs, ensuring that blocks are evenly distributed across XCDs while maximizing data locality.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern should be better because it explicitly considers the number of XCDs and the total number of blocks to compute a new block index. This approach aims to ensure that blocks accessing the same data are more likely to be scheduled on the same XCD, thereby improving L2 cache hit rates and reducing execution time. By balancing the workload across XCDs while maintaining data locality, the new pattern should enhance performance compared to previous attempts.

The pattern ensures that blocks accessing the same data are scheduled to the same XCD, maximizing cache utilization and balancing the workload across XCDs.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern is designed to take full advantage of the MI300X architecture by ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD.
