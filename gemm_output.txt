--- MEMORY ANALYSIS ---
The `streamk_gemm` kernel exhibits specific memory access patterns and locality characteristics that can be leveraged to improve performance:

1. **Access Patterns:**
   - **Matrix A and B:** The kernel accesses these matrices in blocks, with `A_BASE` and `B_BASE` calculated using indices `rm`, `rn`, and `rk`. The use of `tl.multiple_of` and `tl.max_contiguous` suggests alignment efforts for better cache line utilization.
   - **Matrix C:** The result is stored in blocks, with access determined by `C_` using `rm` and `rn`. Masks ensure only valid elements are written, handling edge cases.
   - **Bias:** Accessed using `bias_ptr` and `rm`, straightforward due to single-dimensional access.

2. **Locality:**
   - **Spatial Locality:** Maximized by accessing contiguous memory blocks, ensuring consecutive threads access consecutive locations.
   - **Temporal Locality:** Limited due to independent block processing, but accumulation in `acc` may offer some benefits.
   - **Cache Utilization:** Controlled via `tl.load` and `tl.store` with cache modifiers, and `tl.debug_barrier` for synchronization.

3. **Optimization Opportunities:**
   - **Block Swizzling:** Consider swizzling block IDs (e.g., Z-order or Hilbert curve) to enhance cache locality.
   - **Prefetching:** Explicit prefetching into shared memory or registers could hide memory latency, especially for large matrices.

These insights can guide optimizations to improve cache performance and overall efficiency of the kernel.

--- MEMORY ANALYSIS REASONING ---
The `streamk_gemm` kernel is a matrix multiplication operation with additional features like bias addition and handling of non-even dimensions. The kernel is designed to work on blocks of matrices A, B, and C, with specific block sizes defined by `BLOCK_SIZE_M`, `BLOCK_SIZE_N`, and `BLOCK_SIZE_K`. The memory access patterns are crucial for understanding how data is loaded and stored, which directly impacts performance due to cache utilization.

1. **Memory Access Patterns:**
   - **Matrix A and B Access:** The kernel accesses matrix A and B in blocks. For matrix A, the access pattern is determined by `A_BASE`, which is calculated using the row indices `rm` and column indices `rk`. Similarly, for matrix B, `B_BASE` is calculated using `rk` and `rn`. The use of `tl.multiple_of` and `tl.max_contiguous` suggests an attempt to align memory accesses to improve cache line utilization.
   - **Matrix C Access:** The result of the matrix multiplication is stored in matrix C. The access pattern for C is determined by `C_`, which is calculated using `rm` and `rn`. The use of masks ensures that only valid elements are written, which is important for handling edge cases where the block size does not perfectly divide the matrix dimensions.
   - **Bias Access:** If bias is used, it is accessed using `bias_ptr` and `rm`. This access pattern is straightforward as it involves a single dimension.

2. **Memory Locality:**
   - **Spatial Locality:** The kernel attempts to maximize spatial locality by accessing contiguous blocks of memory. This is evident in the use of `tl.arange` and the block-based approach, which ensures that consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.
   - **Temporal Locality:** Temporal locality is less pronounced in this kernel since each block of the matrix is processed independently. However, the use of shared memory (if any) and the accumulation of results in `acc` can provide some temporal locality benefits.
   - **Cache Utilization:** The kernel uses `tl.load` and `tl.store` with cache modifiers like `.wt` and `.cv`, which suggest an attempt to control cache behavior explicitly. The use of `tl.debug_barrier` indicates synchronization points that might be used to ensure data consistency across threads.

3. **Potential Improvements:**
   - **Block Swizzling:** By analyzing the access patterns, one could consider swizzling the block IDs to improve cache locality. For instance, processing blocks in a Z-order curve or a Hilbert curve might improve cache performance by keeping related data closer in memory.
   - **Prefetching:** Explicit prefetching of data into shared memory or registers could be considered to hide memory latency, especially for large matrices where global memory access is a bottleneck.

Overall, the kernel is designed to take advantage of block-based processing to improve memory access patterns, but there might be opportunities to further optimize cache utilization through block swizzling and prefetching strategies.

Iteration 0:
Code optimization prompt:
None

Code optimization reasoning:
The current implementation of the `streamk_gemm` kernel does not utilize an optimal swizzling pattern for block assignment to XCDs. The default round-robin scheduling does not consider the memory access patterns of the blocks, which can lead to suboptimal cache utilization. By reassigning block indices to better align with the data access patterns, we can improve cache locality and overall performance.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The default round-robin scheduling assigns blocks to XCDs without considering the data they access, leading to poor cache locality and increased memory latency.",
    "iteration 2": "Blocks that access the same data are not guaranteed to be scheduled on the same XCD, resulting in inefficient use of the L2 cache and potential cache thrashing."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization involves implementing a custom swizzling pattern that reassigns block indices based on their data access patterns. This pattern aims to map blocks that access the same or overlapping data to the same XCD, thereby improving cache locality and reducing memory latency. The swizzling pattern is designed to ensure an even distribution of blocks across XCDs while maximizing the reuse of cached data.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern should be better because it explicitly considers the data access patterns of the blocks, ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are more likely to be scheduled on the same XCD. This improves the likelihood of cache hits in the L2 cache, reducing memory latency and improving overall performance. Additionally, the even distribution of blocks across XCDs ensures balanced workload and efficient utilization of resources.

Swizzling formula:
assigned_xcd = (pid // NUM_XCDS) + (pid % NUM_XCDS) * (num_blocks // NUM_XCDS)
pid = assigned_xcd

--- PROFILING ITERATION 1 ---
L2 Cache Locality Improvement: Successfully improved L2 cache hit rate by 15.46 percentage points. Hit rate increased from 47.7% to 63.2% (higher percentages indicate better cache locality through improved block swizzling). Performance Loss: Experienced 1.01x slowdown with execution time increased from 5.31ms to 5.33ms (0.5% slower).

Iteration 1:
Code optimization prompt:
None

Code optimization reasoning:
The original kernel code uses a straightforward block assignment strategy that does not take full advantage of the MI300X architecture's multiple XCDs, each with its own L2 cache. The previous optimization attempt introduced a swizzling pattern to improve L2 cache locality by reassigning block indices to XCDs. However, this approach resulted in a slight performance slowdown, indicating that the swizzling pattern may not have been optimal for balancing workload across XCDs while maximizing cache hits.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The swizzling pattern used in iteration 1 attempted to improve L2 cache locality by reassigning block indices based on a formula involving division and modulo operations. However, this approach may have led to uneven distribution of blocks across XCDs, causing some XCDs to be overloaded while others were underutilized. This imbalance could have resulted in increased execution time due to inefficient use of available resources."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization will implement a swizzling pattern that aims to evenly distribute blocks across XCDs while ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD. This will be achieved by using a combination of block index manipulation and modulo operations to create a more balanced and efficient distribution of workload across the XCDs.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern should be better because it focuses on achieving a more balanced distribution of blocks across XCDs, which can lead to improved utilization of the GPU's resources. By ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD, the new pattern should also enhance L2 cache locality, reducing memory access latency and potentially improving overall performance.

Swizzling formula:
assigned_xcd = (pid % NUM_XCDS) * (num_blocks // NUM_XCDS) + (pid // NUM_XCDS)
pid = assigned_xcd

--- PROFILING ITERATION 2 ---
L2 Cache Locality Improvement: Successfully improved L2 cache hit rate by 16.89 percentage points. Hit rate increased from 47.7% to 64.6% (higher percentages indicate better cache locality through improved block swizzling). Performance Gain: Achieved 1.02x speedup with execution time reduced from 5.31ms to 5.22ms (1.6% faster).

Iteration 2:
Code optimization prompt:
None

Code optimization reasoning:
The current kernel code uses a swizzling pattern to improve L2 cache locality by reassigning block indices to XCDs. The goal is to ensure that blocks accessing the same data are mapped to the same XCD, thereby improving cache hit rates. The previous attempts have shown improvements in cache locality and performance, but there is still room for further optimization by exploring different swizzling strategies.

Reason why old was slow:
{
    "iteration 1": "The swizzling pattern did not fully optimize the distribution of blocks across XCDs, leading to a slight performance slowdown despite improved cache locality.",
    "iteration 2": "While the swizzling pattern improved cache locality and performance, it may not have fully leveraged the potential of the hardware architecture to balance the load across XCDs optimally."
}

Summary of optimization:
The new optimization will implement a swizzling pattern that aims to balance the load across XCDs more effectively by considering both the block index and the number of XCDs. This approach will attempt to ensure that blocks accessing the same data are more likely to be mapped to the same XCD, while also maintaining an even distribution of blocks across all XCDs.

Reason why new should be better:
The new swizzling pattern should be better because it takes into account both the block index and the number of XCDs to achieve a more balanced distribution of blocks. This should lead to improved cache locality by ensuring that blocks accessing the same data are more likely to be mapped to the same XCD, while also maintaining an even distribution of blocks across all XCDs. This approach should improve both cache hit rates and overall performance.

Swizzling formula:
assigned_xcd = (pid // NUM_XCDS) + (pid % NUM_XCDS) * (num_blocks // NUM_XCDS)
pid = (assigned_xcd + (pid // (num_blocks // NUM_XCDS))) % num_blocks
