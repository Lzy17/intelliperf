abstract: "IntelliPerf is an automated performance engineering framework that addresses the complex challenge of GPU kernel optimization. It systematizes the optimization workflow by orchestrating a comprehensive toolchain that automatically profiles applications using rocprofiler-compute, identifies high-level bottlenecks with Guided Tuning, pinpoints specific source code lines using Omniprobe, generates optimized code through Large Language Models (LLMs), and validates results using Accordo for correctness and performance."
